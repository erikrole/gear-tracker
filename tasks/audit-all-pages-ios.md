# Audit: all pages and sheets (iOS) - 2026-07-03

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Scope correction:** all native Wisconsin iOS pages, pushed detail screens, sheets, confirmation flows, scanner/search covers, profile/settings drill-downs, dev tools, and kiosk-only screens.
**Ship bar:** student-friendly, fully functional for core flows, zero hiccups in front of a class.

## Current Verification Baseline

- [x] `npm run drift:ios` passed after the first screenshot batch.
- [x] `npm run audit:ios:gaps` passed with 44/44 audit-worthy surfaces covered and 0 missing audits. It still reports 7 pre-existing unregistered extracted kiosk/create-booking files.
- [x] `npm run verify:docs` passed after Home and Schedule changes.
- [x] XcodeBuildMCP `build_run_sim` passed for the main `Wisconsin` app after Home and Schedule changes, with no warnings.

## Inventory Method

- Source inventory: `rg --files ios/Wisconsin | rg '\.swift$'`
- Surface inventory: `rg -n "struct .*: View|sheet\(|fullScreenCover\(|popover\(|confirmationDialog\(|NavigationLink|navigationDestination|Tab\(" ios/Wisconsin`
- Audit history: `find tasks -maxdepth 1 -name 'audit-*-ios*.md' -print | sort`
- Runtime proof: XcodeBuildMCP screenshot and runtime UI snapshot per reachable surface.

  - Result: clean in current empty state. Post Trade remains visible, open work copy is clear, and no stale approval-review sections appear.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/Schedule/TradeBoardSheet.swift`, `tasks/audit-schedule-ios.md`
- [x] Post Trade sheet
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_363751c2-141e-4620-a986-d59d9d8d86ac.jpg`

- [x] Event Detail sheet
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_2bab9796-7560-4f7e-95de-4525d8c1a4e6.jpg`
  - Result: clean. All-day range is date-only, event context leads, reserve action is inline, and crew rows remain readable at iPhone width.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/EventDetailSheet.swift`, `tasks/audit-schedule-ios.md`
- [ ] Assign Student sheet
- [x] Add Shift sheet
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_f9a640f7-1f43-4d45-88c7-286040ad11b4.jpg`

  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/Schedule/AddShiftSheet.swift`, `tasks/audit-schedule-ios.md`
- [ ] Edit Shift Times sheet

  - Fix shipped: shared picker rows no longer force short labels into a 40-point column, linked all-day events now show date-only `All day` header copy instead of midnight times across selected and prefilled event paths, and picker rows expose full-width hit targets.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBookingSheet.swift`, `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBooking/CreateBookingFormRows.swift`, `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBooking/CreateBookingPickers.swift`, `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBooking/CreateBookingViewModel.swift`, `tasks/audit-create-booking-ios.md`
- [x] Create Booking event picker
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_3153084f-d085-4c84-a56f-92b445250d55.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Native searchable pushed list has clear title/back behavior, readable event rows, and explicit selected-state affordance.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBooking/CreateBookingEventViews.swift`, `tasks/audit-create-booking-ios.md`
- [x] Create Booking pickup picker
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_c13fbb3e-3c0f-4a0d-ae44-8980e95fa9c7.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Native pushed picker uses clear title/back behavior, simple 44-point rows, and a system search field.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBooking/CreateBookingPickers.swift`, `tasks/audit-create-booking-ios.md`
- [x] Create Booking sheet, Equipment step
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_1832e80e-a63e-4352-b3ec-2e2582af6855.jpg`
  - Fix shipped: attachment categories are hidden from reservation equipment browsing, even when stored category names still contain `Accessories`.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBooking/CreateBookingViewModel.swift`, `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBooking/CreateBookingEquipmentPicker.swift`, `tasks/audit-create-booking-ios.md`
- [x] Create Booking cart sheet
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_c8210064-1527-4329-8815-eb2938572791.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Medium-detent drawer has a native title/done rhythm, selected item thumbnail/title/subtitle, and a visible remove action.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBooking/CreateBookingEquipmentPicker.swift`, `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBooking/CreateBookingEquipmentRows.swift`, `tasks/audit-create-booking-ios.md`
- [ ] Create Booking QR scanner cover
- [x] Create Booking Confirm step
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_93ea3475-ab44-4f38-8d60-0d3b3a4cbdba.jpg`
  - Fix shipped: linked all-day reservations show date-only pickup window and `Return after event` instead of midnight pickup/return timestamps.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBookingSheet.swift`, `tasks/audit-create-booking-ios.md`
- [x] Create Booking discard confirmation
  - Runtime snapshot: `Discard reservation?`, message `Your changes will be lost.`, destructive `Discard`.
  - Result: clean. Confirmation appears only after unsaved input and keeps the destructive action explicit.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/CreateBookingSheet.swift`, `tasks/audit-create-booking-ios.md`
- [x] More directory
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_0e88725a-cad3-4cbc-8f15-5942231d3cd3.jpg`

  - Result: clean. Native toolbar filters/sort are visible, rows expose tag/model/location/status, and regular browsing keeps attachments hidden.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/ItemsView.swift`, `tasks/audit-items-list-ios.md`
- [x] Item Detail
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_4c06d113-c53c-4962-b37b-903a41398c84.jpg`
  - Fix shipped: bundled child rows use current `Attachments` UI and VoiceOver language. Raw detail category values still reflect backend taxonomy, so standalone items like a teleconverter may still show `Category: Accessories`.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/ItemDetailView.swift`, `tasks/audit-item-detail-ios.md`
- [ ] Edit Asset sheet
- [x] Item image zoom cover
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_6045a110-481b-485e-8c1e-09fa727cf417.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Full-screen viewer uses a black backdrop, keeps the catalog image uncropped, and exposes an explicit `Close photo` button.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/ItemDetailView.swift`, `ios/Wisconsin/Views/ZoomableImageViewer.swift`
- [x] Guides list
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_205d7226-3cbb-4cab-8c6b-1cfb971cd593.jpg`
  - Fix shipped: Guide rows expose compact VoiceOver labels instead of full Markdown-derived summaries.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/GuidesView.swift`, `tasks/audit-guides-ios.md`
- [x] Guide reader
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_637461c1-bdd6-42be-b625-bf7ba23d9139.jpg`
  - Fix shipped: ordered Markdown runs render continuous numbers and the pushed article hides the tab bar so bottom chrome does not cover reader text.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/GuidesView.swift`, `tasks/audit-guides-ios.md`
- [x] Licenses list
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_c342b030-681b-4dd5-8f55-1279740f7c21.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Active claim, copy/return actions, pool rows, slot counts, and staff/admin code visibility match the documented self-service scope.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/LicensesView.swift`, `tasks/audit-licenses-ios.md`
- [x] Claim/return license confirmations
  - Runtime snapshot: `Return Photo Mechanic license?` with explanatory copy and destructive `Return License`; mutation was not confirmed. Claim confirmation was not reachable because the live user already has an active claim, and claim buttons are correctly hidden in that state.
  - Result: clean. Destructive return is confirmed; claim remains single-license guarded.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/LicensesView.swift`, `tasks/audit-licenses-ios.md`
- [x] Users list
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_1ee16b49-ecb3-478c-bb62-edcd18ef54c3.jpg`
  - Fix shipped: list rows no longer repeat routine location copy such as `Camp Randall`; they keep role, title/year, and primary area.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/UsersView.swift`, `tasks/audit-users-ios.md`
- [x] User Detail
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_32f3681c-88ff-4fdb-b6b6-3450f2f370af.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Profile header omits location, preserves avatar/email/role/joined metadata, and keeps badges plus booking cards readable.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/UserDetailView.swift`, `tasks/audit-users-ios.md`
- [x] Badge Gallery sheet
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_fc880878-f579-477b-a470-c18bfa10e682.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Large sheet uses native Done action, summary counts, horizontal filter chips, and readable badge tiles.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/UserDetailView.swift`, `tasks/audit-users-ios.md`
- [x] Badge Detail sheet
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_e2be5e5c-b60d-498b-9429-acd77a0fbb87.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Nested sheet keeps artifact/title/description first, has an explicit Done action, and scrolls the metric grid.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/UserDetailView.swift`, `tasks/audit-users-ios.md`
- [x] Search tab
  - Screenshots: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_bd11aa33-51b7-4291-8bea-64728d1d0b44.jpg`, `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_c23366e4-8b5c-4ec1-96df-48ae068250ee.jpg`
  - Fix shipped: typed item/family results filter attachment/accessory categories while QR/direct scan lookup stays able to resolve child attachments.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/Search/GlobalSearchSheet.swift`, `ios/Wisconsin/Core/SearchService.swift`, `tasks/audit-search-ios.md`
- [x] Search scanner cover
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_a057ded1-fb07-4631-9e5d-c3ca8a2b5cf1.jpg`
  - Result: clean for Simulator/unsupported-camera path. Scanner cover shows close affordance plus typed-code recovery; camera-authorized hardware path remains covered by existing source audit.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/Search/QRScannerSheet.swift`, `tasks/audit-scan-ios.md`
- [ ] Search result destinations
- [x] QR scanner manual-entry sheet
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_95a10250-6bd7-4d5a-bfb5-cc8e52715702.jpg`
  - Fix shipped: unavailable scanner controls hide behind the typed-code sheet so the form no longer sits over a glowing fallback button.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/Search/QRScannerSheet.swift`, `ios/Wisconsin/Views/ScanView.swift`, `tasks/audit-scan-ios.md`
- [x] Notifications sheet
  - Covered by Notification Settings runtime surface and source ownership. The toolbar bell entry opens the same notification inbox/settings ownership path; no unread state mutation performed.
- [x] Profile / Settings hub
  - Screenshots: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_2fac7dd5-bb21-4dbb-9626-08d6aa891d3e.jpg`, `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_93a11174-5b9c-4a11-9f5c-fe419e930726.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Grouped native Settings hub shows account, schedule, directory, notifications, appearance, tools, app, and isolated sign-out sections.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/ProfileView.swift`, `tasks/audit-profile-ios.md`
- [x] Account Security settings
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_bbb035a9-10bd-4188-878a-d4a3de253645.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Native secure fields, show-password control, sign-out-other-devices switch, validation, and disabled submit state are present.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/AccountSecuritySettingsView.swift`, `tasks/audit-profile-ios.md`
- [x] Notification Settings
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_b381f487-b037-4fa6-9d08-7abc9f60c143.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Delivery status, pause chips, channel switches, and category toggles are native and readable; live preferences were not changed.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/NotificationSettingsView.swift`, `tasks/audit-profile-ios.md`
- [x] Push pre-prompt
  - Source-audited. Current Simulator/account has push already allowed, so the not-determined pre-prompt path is not runtime-reachable without resetting OS permission state.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/PushPrePromptView.swift`, `tasks/audit-profile-ios.md`
- [x] Availability list
  - Source-audited; current logged-in admin profile does not expose the student-scheduling-class entry.
  - Fix shipped: destructive availability swipe delete now requires confirmation.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/AvailabilityView.swift`, `tasks/audit-availability-ios.md`
- [x] Add Availability sheet
  - Source-audited; current logged-in admin profile does not expose the student-scheduling-class entry.
  - Result: clean source pass. Native Form uses pickers, date/time controls, optional label, validation, and disabled saving state.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/AvailabilityView.swift`, `tasks/audit-availability-ios.md`
- [x] Link Sticker Wizard
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_1be9e327-22f7-471b-864e-057bc1e08007.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Three-step staff/admin sheet opens with scanner unavailable fallback and manual entry; no link mutation performed.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/DevTools/LinkStickerWizard.swift`, `tasks/audit-link-sticker-wizard-ios.md`
- [x] Scanner Debugger
  - Screenshot: `/var/folders/_x/t6hvydvd77167wrmgclk3nc1bq8t3g/T/screenshot_optimized_e024c134-8832-47a4-a78e-d5f7e6a77569.jpg`
  - Result: clean. Large sheet shows HID readiness, raw/trimmed/lookup status rows, and typed fallback.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/DevTools/ScannerDebuggerView.swift`, `tasks/audit-scanner-debugger-ios.md`
- [x] Overdue Report
  - Source-audited. Current account has zero overdue bookings; Profile row is present and routes to `OverdueReportView`, though the runtime tap target did not push reliably from the current sheet scroll position.
  - Files: `ios/Wisconsin/Views/OverdueReportView.swift`, `tasks/audit-overdue-report-ios.md`

## Active Findings And Fixes

### Fixed in this pass

- [x] Home hero accessibility duplication. Runtime snapshot previously exposed both a combined greeting and separate child text. `DashboardHero` now ignores children for accessibility and exposes one label with the visible date and greeting.
- [x] Schedule all-day my-shift row label. Runtime snapshot previously announced `Event 12:00 AM to 12:00 AM`; the row now announces `All day, Day n of m`.
- [x] Create Reservation details picker label wrap. Simulator screenshot showed `Pickup` splitting across two lines; shared form picker rows now keep labels to intrinsic one-line width and let values truncate.
- [x] Create Reservation all-day linked-event header. Selecting Football Media Day no longer renders `12:00 AM` times in the Details header; it uses date-only `All day` copy unless the user manually edits the window.
- [x] Create Reservation picker hit areas. Requester and pickup rows now make the full visible row tappable, matching native list-row expectations and the simulator runtime target.
- [x] Create Reservation attachment filtering. The Equipment step no longer shows attachment categories in browsing chips or result groups, even when the stored category label is `Accessories`.
- [x] Create Reservation review all-day copy. Confirm no longer renders `12:00 AM` pickup/return times for all-day event-linked reservations.
- [x] Item Detail attachment wording. The child bundle card now says `Attachments` and VoiceOver announces `Attachment`, while standalone backend category names remain unchanged.
- [x] Users list location cleanup. Native profile rows no longer repeat routine `Camp Randall` location context.
- [x] Guides reader polish. Ordered guide steps now render continuous numbers, guide rows use compact VoiceOver labels, and pushed article screens hide the tab bar.
- [x] Licenses runtime pass. Active-code self-service and return confirmation were verified without mutating the live license pool.
- [x] Search attachment filtering. The `fx3` typed query now returns camera bodies only and hides handle/attachment rows from normal Search.
- [x] Search scanner manual-entry polish. The unsupported-camera fallback no longer bleeds through the typed-code sheet.

### Next batch

1. Bookings list, Booking Detail, Edit Booking, Extend Booking, Create Booking.
2. More directory, Items, Item Detail, Guides, Licenses, Users, badges.
3. Search, scanner, notifications, profile/settings, availability, dev tools.
4. Kiosk-only screens under the `WisconsinKiosk` target.

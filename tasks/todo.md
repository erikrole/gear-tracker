### Review
- Dashboard Upcoming Events Parity shipped: the dashboard Upcoming Events card now uses schedule-style read-only coverage metadata from `/api/dashboard`, shows event title, time, location, home/away state, staffing avatars, filled/total coverage, open-slot warnings, and home call time when available. Quick-create controls were removed from the widget, keeping `/schedule` as the management surface. Verification passed for TypeScript, migration-prefix check, whitespace, and local Next build.
- Item Detail Tabs Final Polish shipped: Schedule now pairs the month grid with a compact agenda row list, continuous week-spanning booking bars, quieter Today control, completed trailing calendar cells, and filters cancelled bookings out of occupied schedule and quick Past Bookings views. QR details are owned by the QR preview instead of a separate visible action. Calendar booking clicks keep users in context with a lighter booking preview sheet that matches the current app chrome, uses requester/creator avatars for human context, and routes deeper work to the full booking page. Insights now uses completion audit activity for return timing when available, labels the metric honestly, and shows item age in years for older gear. Attachments now hides the travel rule when no children exist and explains when fixed accessories should be added. Verification passed for TypeScript, migration-prefix check, whitespace, local route checks, authenticated Chrome DevTools tab checks, and console review.
- Item Detail Tabs Follow-up shipped: Schedule now uses clickable continuation/end markers instead of repeating long booking names across every occupied day. Past Bookings now pulls requester avatar URLs through the detail API and renders compact rows with title, requester, date range, kind, and status. History now has All / Item updates / Bookings scopes, backend scope filtering, cursor pagination, cleaner legacy audit labels, and quieter import metadata handling. Verified with TypeScript, migration-prefix check, whitespace check, local route checks, and authenticated Chrome DevTools checks on Info, Schedule, and History.
- Item Detail Tab Direction Pass shipped: the detail tab rail now uses a quieter thin active underline, removes the redundant Bookings tab, renames Calendar to Schedule, and removes visible shortcut numerals. Info now includes Past Bookings beneath upcoming reservations with requester avatars and clearer booking context. Insights is a compact signal view, History is framed around the full item touch log, Attachments has operational summary/direction, and Settings reads as workflow eligibility policy. Verification passed for TypeScript, migration-prefix check, whitespace, local route checks, and `npx next build`.
- Item Detail Data Form Hardening shipped: shared inline save controls now use a ref guard against rapid duplicate saves, show saving state instead of competing save/cancel controls, disable text/select/date/notes/QR inputs while requests are active, and toast actual save errors. Asset PATCH now trims incoming strings, accepts clearable nullable fields, allows zero-value financial fields, saves department by ID, and parses server error bodies consistently. The shared API CSRF guard now compares against the actual request origin, so localhost item saves are not rejected before auth/permissions while bad origins still return 403. The info card now uses consistent gray picker surfaces for select/category/date/year controls, a year-only Fiscal Year picker, a shared Admin badge, and a top-aligned notes row.
- Home Dashboard Focused Pass shipped: dashboard rows now use one shared row component, no longer nest action buttons inside clickable row buttons, and use a safer mobile layout with predictable truncation. Filter clear no longer nests a focusable pseudo-button inside the popover trigger. Docs synced in `AREA_DASHBOARD.md`. Verification passed for TypeScript, migration-prefix check, and local Next build; exact `npm run build` remains blocked at remote Prisma migrate deploy.
- Home Dashboard Follow-up Pass shipped: overdue banner rows now split open/check-in/nudge into sibling controls, saved filter presets now split apply/delete into sibling controls, and the production browser check confirms the app can render `/login`; dashboard visual inspection still needs an authenticated browser session.
- Home Dashboard Console Polish shipped: stat cards are quieter and section headers now share one component, reducing repeated header styling across My Gear and Team Activity.
- Home Dashboard Live Browser Polish shipped: local login now works on `localhost:7001`, the dashboard renders without the Next dev issue badge, buttons/toggles have explicit tactile transitions, and the Upcoming Events header stays readable in narrow columns.
- Sidebar Polish Pass shipped: sidebar nav rows are quieter without permanent index numbers, icon states are clearer, hover/active transitions are explicit, and collapsed mode was checked live.
- Schedule Page Focused Pass shipped: New Event no longer relies on invalid empty Select values, location loading and event creation redirect/error paths are explicit, schedule row expansion uses a real expand control instead of a focusable row-link hybrid, inline schedule mutations have ref-backed duplicate-submit guards, and the live Arc console is down to normal dev noise after a reload.
- Schedule Command Bar + Coverage Pass shipped: Needs staff is now a first-class schedule command, secondary filters keep their own count, the list header/rows surface open-slot coverage gaps without requiring the shift panel, and the live shift-trades reload error is cleared.
- Schedule Readiness Polish Pass shipped: schedule now opens with an operational snapshot for open slots, ready events, my shifts, open trades, and next visible call time before the date-grouped list.
- Schedule Inline Assignment Matrix Pass shipped: expanded events now show one scannable slot matrix, staff can assign open slots directly from each tile, students keep inline trade posting, and the event manager is exposed as one clear action instead of relying on row-click behavior.
- Schedule Collapsed Staffing Preview Pass shipped: collapsed rows now show assigned-staff avatar groups and open-slot counts, those previews fade on expand, and expanded content returns to dense assignment rows for fully staffed events.
- Schedule Role Language Polish shipped: schedule rows now state staff/student needs in plain language, keep event start/all-day context with the event title, keep expanded role labels neutral to avoid competing color systems, avoid repeating the same need in the collapsed avatar preview, and reserve the right column for real home call times.
- Cross-Page DevTools Cleanup shipped: active filter clears no longer nest buttons, manifest icons use correctly declared app assets, search inputs have stable identifiers, dashboard event titles read cleanly, and schedule call ranges no longer repeat identical start/end times. Authenticated Chrome DevTools checks are clean on dashboard, schedule, bookings, items, users, and guides; abort/retry fetches remain intentional stale-request cancellation.
- Items Page Hardening Pass shipped: item export, duplicate, maintenance, and retire handlers now release busy state through auth redirects and failures; item-list empty states and pagination now key off merged serialized/bulk rows; selection clears when item type, favorites, attachments, filters, or sort changes; CSV export now honors favorites and the same search fields as the list.
- Items Page UX/UI Polish Pass shipped: the toolbar now reads as one command bar with advanced filters behind a toggle, header actions share a compact 32px rhythm, the inventory summary is a compact health grid, and item rows/cards lead with tag plus product identity without duplicating serial or department metadata in the name stack.
- Items Compact + Fill Gaps Upgrade shipped: compact density now removes thumbnails for a plainer shadcn table read, and Fill gaps now preloads a mixed serialized/bulk queue, exposes retryable count/load/save failures, ranks suggestions with same-category department hints including legacy bulk category text, makes no-photo items explicit, and lets staff review skipped items before closing the session.
- Item Detail UX/UI Cleanup Slice 1 shipped: the default Overview now leads with active checkout/upcoming reservation context, keeps item facts as the secondary right column, moves QR scan identity into the facts card, and quiets the header so derived status plus available actions are easier to read.
- Item Detail UX/UI Cleanup Slice 2 shipped: serial number left the header, duplicated brand/model sublines collapse when the product name already contains that identity, location/category/department now have clear slash separators, Check out is the primary available action while Reserve stays secondary, and scan identity rows are labeled.
- Item Detail UX/UI Cleanup Slice 3 shipped: the header action cluster now puts workflow buttons first, keeps Actions with the workflow controls, moves refresh/favorite plus freshness text into a quieter utility row, and removes the blocking freshness tooltip by baking date/time into the Updated line.
- Item Detail UX/UI Cleanup Slice 4 shipped: the admin scan identity panel now uses a compact inset layout with labeled QR/Serial values, matching copyable mono text, and a larger QR preview that owns the manage/view action without a redundant text button.
- Item Detail Hardening + Polish Pass shipped: detail header controls now respect action busy state, favorite toggles are rapid-click guarded, failed item photos render the no-photo fallback, mobile calendar shows a booking list instead of a blank grid area, booking filters use the standard toggle-group, and detail tab fetches clean up stale requests.
- Item Detail Missing Server Chunk Runtime Fix completed: the reported `Cannot find module './1893.js'` error came from stale `.next` server output. Regenerating the Next build produced a coherent `/items/[id]` bundle, and a local production route check returned `200 OK`.
- Camera Attachments shipped: item detail now uses grouped Attachments, SD card slot labels render for tags such as `MBB 17 IV 1A`, scan lookup shows parent/slot context, and docs lock QR-coded batteries to numbered bulk semantics. `npm run build` stopped at remote Prisma migrate deploy; safer local `npx next build` passed.
- Derived Bulk Unit QR Scans shipped: QR values generated by the numbered bulk QR tab, such as `94e068d1-7`, now submit as one validated numbered unit under the parent SKU without converting batteries into serialized items.
- Bulk Battery Hardening shipped: kiosk pickup/check-in now scans numbered battery unit QRs one by one, lookup resolves unit QRs, checkout creation warns on low compatible battery availability, and camera-battery guidance is no longer a hard gate.
- Kiosk battery client and labels shipped: kiosk detail payloads include battery units in the checklist, pickup confirm blocks unscanned planned battery quantities, the iOS pickup subtitle counts bulk quantities, Brother P-Touch labels emphasize the unit number, and battery reporting is pinned as GAP-37.
- React Query cache migration was already shipped in code and documented in `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`; stale GAP-11 status is reconciled in `docs/GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`.
- Cache Slice 1 shipped: repeated `["me"]` and `["form-options"]` query functions now use shared hooks; `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run db:migrate:check`, and `npx next build` passed.
- Cache Slice 2 shipped: persisted query allowlist is now a tested helper; `tests/query-client.test.ts`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run db:migrate:check`, and `npx next build` passed.
- Duplicate allocation check converted from scratch task file into `npm run db:check:dupe-allocations`; `node --check scripts/check-dupe-allocations.mjs` and `npm run db:migrate:check` passed.
- Cache Slice 3 shipped: booking list requester/location filter metadata failures now show a retryable alert instead of silently degrading to empty filters.

### Reservations (P2)
- [x] ~~**Resolve equipment conflict badges**~~ (AC-8) — Already implemented in `BookingEquipmentTab.tsx:53-106`. Fetches conflicts for BOOKED/DRAFT bookings. Verified 2026-04-06.

### Users (P2)
- [x] ~~**Add sport/area assignment CRUD**~~ — Shipped 2026-03-28 (GAP-23). Popover multi-select in UserInfoTab.
- [x] ~~**Session-level active enforcement**~~ — Shipped 2026-04-06. `requireAuth()` checks `user.active` + deactivation deletes sessions.

### Known Bugs (documented with proof tests)
- [x] ~~**Fix `claimTrade()` missing isolation**~~ — Fixed 2026-03-30: SERIALIZABLE added to all shift-trades.ts + shift-assignments.ts transactions.
- [x] ~~**Fix bulk scan TOCTOU**~~ — Fixed 2026-03-30: Quantity guard moved inside SERIALIZABLE transaction.
- [x] ~~**Fix `markCheckoutCompleted` double-return**~~ — Fixed 2026-03-30: Now subtracts `checkedInQuantity` from return amount.
- [x] ~~**Fix CSRF bypass with missing Origin**~~ — Fixed 2026-03-30: Origin header required on all mutating requests (cron exempted via Bearer auth).

## Scan Flow — Low Priority (from 2026-04-09 stress test)
- [x] ~~**Admin override detail logging**~~ — Shipped 2026-04-14: `createAdminOverride` now queries the active scan session, calls `buildScanCompletionState`, and stores `bypassed.missingSerialized`, `bypassed.missingBulk`, `bypassed.missingUnits`, and `bypassed.phase` in the `details` field of both the `OverrideEvent` and the audit entry.
- [ ] **Server-side rate limiting on scan endpoints** — `/api/checkouts/[id]/scan` and `/checkin-scan` have no per-session rate limit. Client-side 1s debounce is the only guard. Migrate to Upstash KV rate limiter when user base grows (tracked in GAP-32).
- [x] ~~**Device context never sent from client**~~ — Shipped 2026-04-14: `use-scan-submission.ts` now sends `deviceContext: navigator.userAgent` on all scan POST requests (both `submitScan` and the numbered-bulk inline fetch).

---

## Phase B Backlog (needs briefs before implementation)

- [x] ~~**Shift email notifications**~~ — Trade lifecycle emails shipped for claimed, completed, approved, and declined trades; broader assignment emails remain out of scope
- [x] ~~**Student availability tracking**~~ — Shipped as recurring weekly unavailability blocks with profile Availability tab and assignment conflict indicators; date-specific exceptions remain optional follow-up
- [x] ~~**Date range grouping**~~ — Already shipped in `BookingInfoTab`: the booking detail "When" field shows connected start/end values with duration. Reconciled 2026-05-05.
- [ ] **Game-Day Readiness Score** — Aggregate metric per event (deferred from scheduling Slice 5)

---

## Notes

- Write a `BRIEF_*.md` or Decision record before implementing any new feature
- Run `npm run build` before any commit
- Every mutation endpoint needs audit logging (D-007)
- Read `NORTH_STAR.md` first in any new Claude session
- When shipping, update the relevant `AREA_*.md` and `GAPS_AND_RISKS.md` (CLAUDE.md rule 12)

## Wins Sprint (2026-04-30)

- [x] Replace `img` with `next/image` in booking detail condition photos
- [x] Remove silent JSON parse swallowing in booking + scan client flows
- [x] Add missing indexes (`notifications.sent_at`, `override_events.created_at`, `bulk_stock_balances.bulk_sku_id`)
- [x] Run `npm run test` (fails on pre-existing unrelated tests: equipment-guidance, shift-trades, create-booking)
- [x] Run `npm run build` (`npm run build` blocked by Prisma schema engine error against Neon; `npx next build` passes)

### Review
- Shipped low-effort hardening on booking + scan client paths and added missing operational indexes.
- Verification complete for compilation (`npx next build` succeeds). Test suite currently red for unrelated pre-existing failures.

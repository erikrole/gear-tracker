### Future — Item Detail Dashboard Overview Tab
- [ ] Add Dashboard tab back as landing page with check-outs, reservations, and events overview on one page
- [ ] Distinct from the dedicated Check-outs and Reservations tabs (which remain for filtered views)

### Reservations V1 — Checkout Parity (Active)
- Plan: `tasks/reservations-v1-plan.md`
- Brief: `docs/BRIEF_RESERVATIONS_V1.md`
- [x] Slice 1: Reservation rules + action gating (reservation-rules.ts, permission enforcement) ✅
- [x] Slice 2: Reservation detail page V2 (tabs, inline edit, actions, equipment panel) ✅
- [x] Slice 3+4: Create flow + sectioned picker + list polish (context menu, overdue badges) ✅
- [ ] Slice 5: Convert-to-checkout flow (explicit endpoint + UI confirmation)

### Phase A Remaining

- [x] **B&H Metadata Enrichment** — Slice 1: Parser + API + Create Form ✅
  - Brief: `docs/BRIEF_BH_ENRICHMENT_V1.md`
  - Parser: `src/lib/services/bh-parser.ts` (JSON-LD + OG + title fallbacks)
  - API: `POST /api/enrichment/bh` (server-side fetch, domain validation)
  - UI: "Paste B&H URL" in create form, auto-prefills brand/model/name
  - Tests: `tests/bh-parser.test.ts` (15 tests)

- [x] **Equipment Guidance Rules** ✅ (shipped in Checkout UX V2)
  - `body-needs-batteries`, `lens-needs-body`, `audio-with-video` all live
  - `drone-battery-check`: deferred — needs drone items first

- [ ] **Student Mobile Hardening** — D-015 accepted, brief missing
  - Write `docs/BRIEF_STUDENT_MOBILE_V1.md` first
  - Define student KPIs: taps-to-action, task-completion time, scan success rate
  - Scope: student dashboard actions, scan parity, owned-work list UX
  - Ref: AREA_MOBILE.md, AREA_DASHBOARD.md, DECISIONS.md D-015

### Phase B Prep

- [ ] **AREA_NOTIFICATIONS.md — D-009 Acceptance**
  - Define escalation recipient model (who gets +24h escalation?)
  - Define alert fatigue controls (per-booking cap, opt-out)
  - Update D-009 from Proposed to Accepted once resolved
  - Ref: docs/AREA_NOTIFICATIONS.md, docs/DECISIONS.md D-009

- [x] **Calendar Source Enable/Disable** ✅
  - Schema: `enabled` field already existed with `@default(true)`
  - Sync: `syncAllCalendarSources()` already filters `{ where: { enabled: true } }`
  - API: `PATCH /api/calendar-sources/[id]` — toggle enabled, update name/url
  - UI: Enable/Disable button per source in Events page source management table
  - Disabled sources dimmed, Sync button disabled when source is disabled

- [x] **Sync Health Admin UI** ✅
  - Events page source table shows: event count, last synced date (with full timestamp tooltip)
  - Error badge with inline error message preview (truncated, full on hover)
  - Status badges: green "active", gray "disabled", red "error"
  - Disabled rows visually dimmed (opacity 0.6)

## Pending Decisions (Must Resolve Before Related Features)

1. D-009: Escalation recipient model — who receives 24h escalation notifications?
2. Venue mapping governance owner — who owns the regex-to-location mapping table?
3. Event sync refresh cadence — what is the Cloudflare Cron schedule?
4. B&H cache TTL — how long to cache enrichment results?
5. Student mobile KPI definitions — taps-to-action target, scan success rate threshold?

## Notes

- Always write a BRIEF_*.md or Decision record before implementing any new feature
- Run `npm run build` before any commit — build failures are avoidable
- Every mutation endpoint needs audit logging — do not skip
- NORTH_STAR.md is the first read for any new Claude session

- [x] **Confirmed 5-min inactivity timer** in KioskShell
- [x] **Updated AREA_KIOSK.md** — all 11 ACs marked complete, full implementation documented

### Booking Flow Overhaul (2026-04-09)

- [x] **Thumbnails everywhere** — `<AssetImage size={36}>` on all equipment rows. Bulk qty stepper capped at max, 44px touch targets.
- [x] **Stress test** — 12 issues found, 8 fixed (broken redirect URL, stale scan state, date validation, audit log deps, draft save await, form-options error state).

## Open Items

### Reservations (P2)
- [x] ~~**Resolve equipment conflict badges**~~ (AC-8) — Already implemented in `BookingEquipmentTab.tsx:53-106`. Fetches conflicts for BOOKED/DRAFT bookings. Verified 2026-04-06.

### Users (P2)
- [x] ~~**Add sport/area assignment CRUD**~~ — Shipped 2026-03-28 (GAP-23). Popover multi-select in UserInfoTab.
- [x] ~~**Session-level active enforcement**~~ — Shipped 2026-04-06. `requireAuth()` checks `user.active` + deactivation deletes sessions.

### Known Bugs (documented with proof tests)
- [x] ~~**Fix `claimTrade()` missing isolation**~~ — Fixed 2026-03-30: SERIALIZABLE added to all shift-trades.ts + shift-assignments.ts transactions.
- [x] ~~**Fix bulk scan TOCTOU**~~ — Fixed 2026-03-30: Quantity guard moved inside SERIALIZABLE transaction.
- [x] ~~**Fix `markCheckoutCompleted` double-return**~~ — Fixed 2026-03-30: Now subtracts `checkedInQuantity` from return amount.
- [x] ~~**Fix CSRF bypass with missing Origin**~~ — Fixed 2026-03-30: Origin header required on all mutating requests (cron exempted via Bearer auth).

## Scan Flow — Low Priority (from 2026-04-09 stress test)
- [x] ~~**Admin override detail logging**~~ — Shipped 2026-04-14: `createAdminOverride` now queries the active scan session, calls `buildScanCompletionState`, and stores `bypassed.missingSerialized`, `bypassed.missingBulk`, `bypassed.missingUnits`, and `bypassed.phase` in the `details` field of both the `OverrideEvent` and the audit entry.
- [ ] **Server-side rate limiting on scan endpoints** — `/api/checkouts/[id]/scan` and `/checkin-scan` have no per-session rate limit. Client-side 1s debounce is the only guard. Migrate to Upstash KV rate limiter when user base grows (tracked in GAP-32).
- [x] ~~**Device context never sent from client**~~ — Shipped 2026-04-14: `use-scan-submission.ts` now sends `deviceContext: navigator.userAgent` on all scan POST requests (both `submitScan` and the numbered-bulk inline fetch).

## Phase B Backlog (needs briefs before implementation)

- [ ] **Shift email notifications** — V1 = in-app only
- [ ] **Student availability tracking** — Declare unavailable dates
- [ ] **Date range grouping** — Connected From/To on booking detail (deferred from Round 3)
- [ ] **Game-Day Readiness Score** — Aggregate metric per event (deferred from scheduling Slice 5)

## Notes

- Write a `BRIEF_*.md` or Decision record before implementing any new feature
- Run `npm run build` before any commit
- Every mutation endpoint needs audit logging (D-007)
- Read `NORTH_STAR.md` first in any new Claude session
- When shipping, update the relevant `AREA_*.md` and `GAPS_AND_RISKS.md` (CLAUDE.md rule 12)

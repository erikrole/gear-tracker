## Recently Shipped

### Booking Flow Overhaul (2026-04-09)
- [x] **Multi-step wizard** — `/checkouts/new` and `/reservations/new` replace `CreateBookingSheet`. 3 steps: Context & Details → Equipment → Confirmation.
- [x] **BookingDetailsSheet Equipment tab** — 3rd tab with unreturned badge count, scan-to-return (inline camera, local QR lookup, audio/haptic), full EquipmentPicker in edit mode.
- [x] **Thumbnails everywhere** — `<AssetImage size={36}>` on all equipment rows. Bulk qty stepper capped at max, 44px touch targets.
- [x] **Stress test** — 12 issues found, 8 fixed (broken redirect URL, stale scan state, date validation, audit log deps, draft save await, form-options error state).
- [x] **Cleanup** — `CreateBookingSheet` and `BookingEquipmentEditor` deleted. Dashboard wired to wizard navigation.

## Phase B Backlog (needs briefs before implementation)

- [ ] **Shift email notifications** — V1 = in-app only
- [ ] **Student availability tracking** — Declare unavailable dates
- [ ] **Date range grouping** — Connected From/To on booking detail (deferred from Round 3)
- [ ] **Game-Day Readiness Score** — Aggregate metric per event (deferred from scheduling Slice 5)

## Notes

- Write a `BRIEF_*.md` or Decision record before implementing any new feature
- Run `npm run build` before any commit
- Every mutation endpoint needs audit logging (D-007)
- Read `NORTH_STAR.md` first in any new Claude session
- When shipping, update the relevant `AREA_*.md` and `GAPS_AND_RISKS.md` (CLAUDE.md rule 12)

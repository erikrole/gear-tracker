# AREA: Guides

## Document Control
- Owner: Erik Role (Wisconsin Athletics Creative)
- Status: Shipped
- Created: 2026-04-14
- Brief: `tasks/guides-plan.md` (archived)

## Description
In-app replacement for Google Docs as the home for Wisconsin Athletics Creative SOPs and how-to guides. Staff author rich documents using BlockNote; students read them in-app. Flat list with category filter — no folder tree needed.

## Components
- `/guides` — list page with category filter chips, search, card grid
- `/guides/[slug]` — server-rendered reader with BlockNote view
- `/guides/new` — create page (Staff/Admin only)
- `/guides/[slug]/edit` — edit page with publish toggle and admin delete

## Data Model
`Guide` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
- `id`, `title`, `slug` (unique, auto-generated from title), `category` (freeform)
- `content` (Json — BlockNote `Block[]` array)
- `published` (boolean, default false)
- `order` (int, for manual sort)
- `authorId` → `User` (Restrict on delete)

Migration: `prisma/migrations/0032_add_guides/migration.sql`

## Auth Rules
| Action | Roles |
|--------|-------|
| Read published guides | All (STUDENT, STAFF, ADMIN) |
| Read draft guides | STAFF, ADMIN |
| Create | STAFF, ADMIN |
| Edit | STAFF (own only), ADMIN (any) |
| Delete | ADMIN only |

All mutations use `createAuditEntry` per D-007.

## Service
`src/lib/guides.ts`:
- `listGuides({ published?, category?, search? })`
- `getGuide(id)`, `getGuideBySlug(slug)`
- `createGuide(...)` — auto-slugifies title, handles collision with `-2`, `-3` suffix
- `updateGuide(id, patch, editorRole, editorId)` — STAFF restricted to own guides; regenerates slug only if title changed
- `deleteGuide(id)`

## API Endpoints
| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/guides` | All | List guides; STUDENT sees published only |
| POST | `/api/guides` | STAFF/ADMIN | Create guide |
| GET | `/api/guides/[id]` | All | Single guide by ID or slug |
| PATCH | `/api/guides/[id]` | STAFF/ADMIN | Update guide |
| DELETE | `/api/guides/[id]` | ADMIN | Delete guide |

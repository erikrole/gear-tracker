## Description

Self-serve iPad kiosk for gear checkout / pickup / return at the equipment counter, plus on-the-floor kiosk activation by staff carrying an iPad. Implementation lives in the **native iOS app** (`ios/Wisconsin/Kiosk/`). The previously-shipped web kiosk surface (`src/app/(kiosk)/kiosk/`) was deleted on 2026-04-24 to remove the dual-implementation maintenance burden — iPads run the Wisconsin app directly and flip into kiosk mode via `KioskStore`.

## Trust Model

The kiosk is intentionally low-friction: no per-student password, no PIN, no biometric. The trust gates are layered:

1. **Physical trust.** The iPad is at the gear counter or carried by staff. Guided Access pins it to the Wisconsin app.
2. **Device authentication.** Each `KioskDevice` is created by an admin in Settings → Kiosk Devices. A 6-digit one-time activation code provisions a `kiosk_session` cookie tied to a specific `KioskDevice` row (with `locationId`, `active`, `lastSeenAt`).
3. **Server-side scope.** `withKiosk()` rejects all `/api/kiosk/*` calls without a valid kiosk-session cookie. Routes do not accept a regular user-session cookie. Bookings created through the kiosk are stamped with `source: "KIOSK"` for the audit trail.
4. **Identity = name picker.** A student taps their tile from the location-scoped roster. There is **no password / PIN / NFC** in V1. This is a deliberate trade-off: the counter is staffed during open hours, and physical+device gates carry the security weight. Misattribution risk (a student tapping the wrong tile or someone else's tile) is mitigated by the audit log and the social context of a staffed counter.

If at some point the kiosk needs to operate unattended or in a less-trusted physical context, a per-student PIN or NFC tap is the natural extension. Not in V1.

## Components

### iOS — Canonical Surface
Files under `ios/Wisconsin/Kiosk/`:

- **`KioskStore.swift`** — `@Observable` state machine. Owns `screen` (`activation | idle | studentHub | checkout | pickup | return | success`), `info` (KioskInfo from activation), inactivity timer, heartbeat task, persisted `kiosk_info_v1` in UserDefaults.
- **`KioskShellView.swift`** — switches between screens, applies dark color scheme, hides system overlays + status bar, captures every touch via `simultaneousGesture` to reset the inactivity timer.
- **`KioskActivationView.swift`** — 6-digit numpad, calls `/api/kiosk/activate`.
- **`KioskIdleView.swift`** — left panel: stats + today's events + active checkouts (polls `/api/kiosk/dashboard` every 30s). Right panel: location-scoped student roster grid (`/api/kiosk/users`).
- **`KioskStudentHubView.swift`** — entry point after a student taps their tile; lists their active checkouts/reservations and routes to checkout/pickup/return.
- **`KioskCheckoutView.swift`** — scan zone + scanned-items list + Complete button.
- **`KioskPickupView.swift`** — for `PENDING_PICKUP` bookings.
- **`KioskReturnView.swift`** — return flow.
- **`KioskSuccessView.swift`** — terminal screen with 5s auto-return to idle.
- **`KioskScannerField.swift`** — invisible UITextField that captures HID barcode-scanner keystrokes.
- **`KioskBarcodeCameraView.swift`** — DataScannerViewController-backed camera fallback for environments without a hand scanner.
- **`KioskAPIClient.swift`** — typed wrapper around `/api/kiosk/*` endpoints.
- **`KioskModels.swift`** — Codable types matching the kiosk API responses.

### Web — Backend + Admin (still used)

- **`src/app/(app)/settings/kiosk-devices/`** — admin CRUD page for `KioskDevice` rows (create, toggle active, delete, view activation code, last-seen timestamp).
- **`src/app/api/kiosk-devices/`** — REST CRUD for kiosk devices (admin/staff only, 401 redirect on mutations).
- **`src/app/api/kiosk/`** — kiosk-only API consumed by the iOS app:
  - `POST /activate` — validates 6-digit code, returns kiosk session
  - `GET /me` — returns kiosk identity
  - `POST /heartbeat` — updates `lastSeenAt`
  - `GET /dashboard` — live stats (active checkouts, today's events, team status)
  - `GET /users` — roster filtered by kiosk's `locationId`
  - `GET /student/[userId]` — a student's active checkouts and reservations
  - `POST /checkout/scan`, `POST /checkout/complete`, `GET /checkout/[id]`
  - `POST /checkin/[id]/scan`, `POST /checkin/[id]/complete`
  - `POST /pickup/[id]/scan`, `POST /pickup/[id]/confirm`
  - `POST /scan-lookup` — read-only item-by-tag lookup
- Numbered battery units scan through the same pickup/check-in endpoints with derived values like `{binQrCodeValue}-{unitNumber}`. Pickup binds the unit to the booking; check-in returns only the scanned unit.
- Pickup and return detail payloads include numbered battery units in the same `items` checklist used by serialized assets, so the native iOS screens count batteries before allowing pickup/return actions.
- Serialized pickup confirmation now requires a successful `CHECKOUT` scan event for each serialized asset on the booking. Kiosk scan lookup accepts asset tag, primary scan code, QR value, `qr-` fallback, and serial number values.
- **Auth helpers:** `withKiosk()` (`src/lib/api.ts`) and `requireKiosk()` (`src/lib/auth.ts`) validate the kiosk-session cookie, refresh `lastSeenAt`, throw 401 if inactive/deactivated.

| AC-15 | Heartbeat / dashboard 401 routes back to activation | ✅ Complete (2026-04-24) |

## Known Gaps

- Manual tag entry path (the third leg of AC-6) is not yet exposed in the iOS UI. Camera fallback covers most "scanner unavailable" cases. Track for a follow-up sprint.
- No search / first-letter filter on the avatar grid. Acceptable for ≤30-student locations; revisit on larger-roster rollouts.
- No "wrong person" undo path inside kiosk — admin must fix from web. Acceptable for V1.
- Activation code rotation lifecycle: once a device is activated and its cookie is intact, the original code is no longer needed; if cookie is wiped admin must regenerate from Settings → Kiosk Devices.

## Change Log
| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-04-07 | Area doc created, all ACs pending |
| 2026-04-09 | AC-1 complete: Admin CRUD for kiosk devices shipped at `/settings/kiosk-devices`. |
| 2026-04-14 | AC-2–AC-13 complete: Full web kiosk flow shipped — activation, idle screen, avatar grid, student hub, checkout flow, return flow, scan lookup, inactivity timer, source=KIOSK audit trail, withKiosk auth on all routes. |
| 2026-04-29 | Audit-driven hardening: `kiosk/users`, `kiosk/dashboard`, `kiosk/student/[userId]` now scope reads by `kiosk.locationId` (D-032). Kiosk check-in unified under `bookings-checkin.ts` (`kioskCheckinAsset`, `kioskCompleteCheckin`) — bulk items, scan-session close, and SERIALIZABLE wrapping match the web path. Kiosk checkout/complete uses `nextBookingRef` with a per-kind advisory lock to eliminate refNumber races. All `/api/kiosk/*` mutating routes now Zod-validate bodies. `withKiosk` requires Origin on mutations (parity with `withAuth`). Misleading P2002 error message split between refNumber-collision (retry) and item-conflict (409 unavailable). Heartbeat now accepts GET in addition to POST. |
| 2026-04-24 | **iOS canonical, web kiosk deprecated.** Deleted `src/app/(kiosk)/kiosk/` (3,400 LOC) — all kiosk surfaces now run in the native iOS app. AREA doc rewritten with explicit Trust Model section. Added camera fallback (DataScannerViewController-backed) for AC-6. Added AC-14: scanned-cart preserved across inactivity reset (mid-flow scans no longer silently lost). Added AC-15: heartbeat and idle-dashboard 401s now route back to activation instead of silently failing. UI polish: shared `Color.kioskRed` extension, first-name+last-initial disambiguation on roster collisions, friendlier activation copy, back-button confirms when scanned items present. |
| 2026-05-05 | Numbered battery unit hardening: pickup/check-in scan routes now accept derived unit QR values, bind or return one unit at a time, and kiosk scan lookup resolves battery unit status with parent SKU context. |
| 2026-05-05 | iOS kiosk battery checklist hardening: checkout detail payloads now include pending battery scan slots and checked-out battery units, and pickup confirm blocks until planned battery quantities are scanned. |
| 2026-05-06 | Battery scan mismatch polish: kiosk pickup/return now distinguishes wrong battery type, unit already checked out elsewhere, unit not checked out on this booking, duplicate pickup scans, and lost/retired units. |
| 2026-05-08 | API hardening Wave 11: activation now uses tighter IP and per-code rate limits, and kiosk scan lookup applies per-device minute/hour limits before item lookup. |
| 2026-05-08 | API hardening Wave 13: kiosk sessions now expire after 7 days, heartbeat is capped to 1/min/device, and student lookup is rate-limited per kiosk/IP plus per student. |
| 2026-05-08 | Pickup integrity hardening: serialized pickup scans now write scan evidence, pickup confirmation blocks until all serialized assets have successful checkout scans, and serial-number scanner input is accepted. |
| 2026-05-09 | Badge achievements Slice 2: kiosk direct checkout and pickup confirmation now emit feature-flagged checkout-opened badge events after audit success. With `BADGES_ENABLED` off, these calls return before evaluator work or badge queries. |
| 2026-05-09 | Badge achievements Slice 3: kiosk checkout, pickup, and check-in scan routes now emit feature-flagged scan-result badge events. Native checkout scan requests include the selected student `actorId`; older clients without `actorId` keep scanning without badge attribution. |
